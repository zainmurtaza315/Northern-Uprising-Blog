                    <p>The Toronto Raptors are no strangers to All-Star Weekend and the festivities it brings along. For the second time in their careers, Raptors guards DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry have been selected to the All Star game. With the event being hosted for the first time outside of the USA, the dynamic backcourt is ready for the big stage, to represent Toronto and all of Canada at the highest level. And why shouldn’t they? The Raptors have a comfortable lead over the 3rd seed in the Eastern Conference and sit a couple games behind Cleveland for first overall in the conference. Raptors are red hot coming into All Star weekend winning 15 of their last 16 games, including stringing together 11 win straight wins in this stretch; a franchise record. But what does this season (which is statistically the best season for the Raptors) show about the team? This may finally mean that the Raptors may earn the respect of the rest of league, their players, owners and referees. It is an understatement to state that the Raptors have been often overlooked for their past accomplishments. Look back as soon as two weeks ago, where newly named head coach David Blatt was chosen to coach the Eastern Conference All Stars over Dwayne Casey, who is leading the Raptors to the best season in their 21 years of existence. However, a situation such as this one should not occur in the near future as the Raptors are proving to be a powerhouse in the Eastern Conference. Canada’s team is on the rise; this could mean the Raptors could be hosting an unofficial tryout for many of the league’s top stars as they arrive in Toronto later this week. Toronto is one of the best cities in the world, and Toronto playing as a host to the NBA’s Elites may finally play a role in leading future NBA stars to commit to the city. Just ask Sir Charles himself, who is one of the biggest fans of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeM86k9oXxc)">Toronto.</a
